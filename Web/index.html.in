This package provides facilities to use the Zorba XQuery engine within
R and also to allow R functions to be called as part of an XQuery
expression.  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery">XQuery</a> is a flexible and powerful language for working
with XML documents.  It allows one to perform database-like queries
and to manipulate the results in a script-like language.
By enhancing the scripting facilities with R, we get the ability
to work with large data in a database-like environment
while combining a multitude of statistical functionality
and a general programming language.
By incorporating XQuery into R, we can facilitate
accessing data across multiple XML documents.

<p> Data that come in XML (including XHTML) include Wikipedia,
Data.gov, KML, PMML...  R help files could also be either written in
XML (e.g. RDocbook) or converted to this format and then queried
dynamically.  Being able to query these bodies of data and being able to
construct new content efficiently is valuable.

<p>
Furthermore, when working with large XML documents,
XQuery can be significantly faster in extracting content.
The combination of XQuery and callbacks to R functions
can be quite effective.
