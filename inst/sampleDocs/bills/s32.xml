	1/6/2009--Introduced.
Amends the Federal Power Act and the Natural Gas Act to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to hold at least one public hearing in each affected county and locality before issuing any authorization for action that may affect public or private land use (other than federal land). Requires FERC to hold one additional public hearing after the initial one if the government of such county or locality requests it in order to address an issue not addressed at the initial hearing.
